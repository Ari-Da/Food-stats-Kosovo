This is a graph representation of open data taken from Kosovo's Agency of statistics. There are three types of graphs done in a Javascript framework - Highcharts. One graph is the stacked graph, which shows the percentage of consume for ten categories of food (meat, fish, fruits, etc.). Another type of graph is the pyramid graph showing the consume distribution in percentage of the ten categories of food, in four different year (2011-2014). And the last graph type is the dual axes graph, which compares the change of consume percentage to the avarage price for a particular category of food.
